## Todo

Note: File upload is not part of the scope of this project. This is a routing/middleware library. The line needs to be drawn somewhere for simplicity's sake. üëç

### MVP for project repo public:

- [x] Make sure params/query/json/x-www-form-urlencoded parsing works
- [x] Make sure special http protocols work (e.g. HEAD/OPTIONS request)
- [x] Have exception handling and error rescuing for dev and prod
- [ ] implement websocket functionality
- [ ] websocket routes should be able to parse params/query from url
- [ ] Design logos
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] make sure ssl/https is easy to enable/configure
- [ ] Design custom 404 and 500 pages

### Future Plans:

- [ ] Add date goals to all of the checklist items
- [ ] form-data parsing
- [ ] Ability to opt out of static indexing?
- [ ] Create middleware (opt-in) that allows a non-indexed public folder
- [ ] create thorough examples for how to create a non-indexed public folder
- [ ] Design website
- [ ] Create a "good" website
- [ ] enable/disable features in dev and prod
- [ ] Create a very basic logging middleware and show examples for how to make a more advanced one.
